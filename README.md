# ssw567hw01

This repository contiains my solution to ssw567 HW 01. 

“Write a function classify_triangle() that takes three  parameters: a, b, and c. The three parameters represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function returns a string that specifies whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral, and whether it is a right triangle as well.”

The following files are present:
  - triangle.py : source code for homework solution
  - triangle_unittest.py : unittest code to test triangle.py
  
As a part of deliverable 3, I will include my answers both on Canvas and below:
  - What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
      No challenges really with the assignment, it was simple to code but remembering python syntax was a bit of a challenge that was easy to overcome with a few Google searches.  
  - What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
      Adequate requirements specification that was detailed enough to complete, but also gives room for interpretation i.e. having user input vs. calling functions in main() or combining checking for differen types of triangles.
  - What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
      As mentioned earlier, it was a bit challenging to remember syntax for python and using unittest for the first time in about two years, but that was overcame.
  - Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
      The criteria I used for determining if I had enough test cases was to have a test case for each triangle classification (isosceles, isosceles and right, scalene, scalene and right, and equilateral), and then also checking for invalid parameter inputs such as letters and negative numbers.  Once I determined I had covered these cases that came to mind when trying to figure out the cases that would most readily cause the program to fail, I felt that testing was complete.
