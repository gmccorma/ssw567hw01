What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 

- No challenges really with the assignment, it was simple to code but remembering python syntax was a 
bit of a challenge that was easy to overcome with a few Google searches.

What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment? 

- Adequate requirements specification that was detailed enough to complete, but also gives room for 
interpretation i.e. having user input vs. calling functions in main() or combining checking for different 
types of triangles.

What challenges did you encounter with the tools? 

- As mentioned earlier, it was a bit challenging to remember syntax for python and using unittest for the 
first time in about two years, but that was overcame.

Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done? 

- The criteria I used for determining if I had enough test cases was to have a test case for each triangle 
classification (isosceles, isosceles and right, scalene, scalene and right, and equilateral), and then also 
checking for invalid parameter inputs such as letters and negative numbers. Once I determined I had covered 
these cases that came to mind when trying to figure out the cases that would most readily cause the program 
to fail, I felt that testing was complete.
